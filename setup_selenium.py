L&I INSURANCE SCRAPER SETUP
==============================================================================

The L&I system (https://li-public.fmcsa.dot.gov) requires JavaScript execution
and cannot be scraped with simple HTTP requests.

To automatically fetch insurance data, you need to install:

1. SELENIUM (Browser Automation):
   pip install selenium

2. CHROME DRIVER:
   - Download from: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/
   - Or install via package manager:
     pip install webdriver-manager

3. CHROME BROWSER:
   - Must have Google Chrome installed

INSTALLATION COMMANDS:
----------------------
pip install selenium webdriver-manager

ALTERNATIVE: Use Playwright (more modern):
-------------------------------------------
pip install playwright
playwright install chromium
